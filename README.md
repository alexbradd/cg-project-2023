# Froggo üê∏

Froggo is a showcase of what the `seng` game engine can do and how it works.
For more more in-depth documentation on the engine, see the `README` inside the
`seng` directory.

This project has been developed as the final evaluation for the Computer Graphics
course at Politecnico di Milano, a.y. 2022/2023.

## Building

Build requirements (for both application and engine):

1. CMake and a C++ compiler supporting at least C++17
2. GLFW 3.3 or newer
3. Vulkan SDK
4. `glslc`

The following dependencies will be automatically fetched by the build system:

1. `fmt` 10.1.1
2. `glm` 0.9.9.8
3. `tinyobjloader` 1.0.6
4. `yaml-cpp` 0.8.0

The following dependencies are included as submodules:

1. `stb`

## Licenses

All the code is licensed under GPLv3.

Assets are usually under different flavours of Creative Commons/unlicensed.
All the licensed ones are in their own folders under `froggo/assets` and have o
their license in a `license.txt` file. If no `license.txt` is provided, either:

1. I made them myself: in this case license can be considered "Do What The F\*\*\*
   You Want" public license (SPDX: `WTFPL`).

   These files include:

   1. All the `*_1x1.png` textures
   2. `diffuse_map.png` and `specular_map.png` textures
   3. `arrow.obj`

2. Generated by blender: I don't really know how to license them, if you need
   them just download Blender and create them yourself.

   These files include:

   1. `plane.obj`
   2. `shader_test_sphere.obj`
   3. `suzanne.obj`
