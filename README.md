# Froggo üê∏

Froggo is a simple frogger-like game where you are the car and are trying to
avoid the pedestrians/animals. It is built upon the `seng` vulkan-based game
engine (included in this repo). For more info on the engine, see the `README`
inside the `seng` directory.

This game has been developed as the final evaluation for the Computer Graphics
course at Politecnico di Milano, a.y. 2022/2023.
