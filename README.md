# Froggo

Froggo is a simple frogger-like game where you are the car and are trying to
avoid the pedestrians/animals. It is built upon the `seng` vulkan-based game
engine (included in this repo).

This game has been developed as the final evaluation for the Computer Graphics
course at Politecnico di Milano, a.y. 2022/2023
